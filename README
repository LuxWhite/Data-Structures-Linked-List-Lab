3) Create a linked list to track the path of a weather system. Each node in the list will contain the
x-coordinate (longitude) and the y-coordinate (latitude). Make sure you implement all your
accessors and mutators, and write both primary and default constructors for each class.



4) Implement all the operations for the linked list as discussed in the lecture notes. The algorithms
for most of the operations is already done for you and there are a few examples of the
implementation in Java and C++. Can you figure out (using Big O) how efficient each
algorithm is?

                    They are O(1)  - constant.


 Call each of the operations from main(). For example, insert the following coordinates into your
list:


X = 72.7 Y = 92.6
X = 48.6 Y = 31.4
X = 35.5 Y = 43.8
X = 24.5 Y = 63.6
X = 64.8 Y = 11.0
X = 54.5 Y = 88.7
X = 50.2 Y = 63.3
X = 64.4 Y = 65.1
X = 3.2 Y = 98.2

Use insert at front then use insert at back.
Display all the node in the list
Count the number of nodes
Check if the list is full or if it is empty
